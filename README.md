# Wishr
Wishr is a small full-stack project I am working on. Its a shareable wishlist web-app (like a cross between a wedding registry and Pintrest board).  

The stack is a VueJS frontend (this repository) and a REST API built with TypeORM (see [here](https://github.com/jdjnovak/wishr-backend.git))
